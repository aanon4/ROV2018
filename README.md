## What's this?

This repository contains most of the code our team is using for this year's [MATE ROV competition](https://www.marinetech.org/rov-competition-2/). It's still a bit of a work-in-progress, but it works pretty well as it is.

## How does it work?

Documentation is coming soon! In the meantime, feel free to take a look around. Most of the files have comments explaining what they do.

## Can I use it?

Yep! Our code is designed to work with our hardware, but you should be able to adapt it to your own needs with a little work. Just make sure you [credit us](#license) if you use our work.
